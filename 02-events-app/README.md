## Events App

### Concepts
- File based routing in NextJS
- Creating React Components (except pages)
- Routing between pages using Link from 'next/link'
- Routing programatically using useRouter hook from 'next/router'

#### File based routing
- Everything Component inside "pages" directory considered as Page and route name will be the name of the file
- For nested routes -> create folder containg files and index.js for home page of that particular route
